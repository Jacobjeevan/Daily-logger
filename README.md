# Daily Logger

I am a fan of experimenting with my habits (particularly checking what
techniques could improve my productivity and happiness).

Currently I am experimenting with Four 2 hour blocks (to emulate a standard working day) and see which techniques work best for me (ex: breaking up the blocks into smaller chunks, pomodoro technique)

I use a combination of Google sheets, drive, writing journal to keep
track of my progress (which works, but is too distributed).

So, Daily logger project was born. This also presented a great opportunity to work with MERN (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js) stack.
